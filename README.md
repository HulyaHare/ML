ManchineLearning

Project Overview:
These projects comprehensively examine machine learning algorithms and techniques. They involve data preparation, model creation, model training, and evaluation processes using libraries such as Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.
Content

My projects include the following topics:
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Data cleaning, missing data analysis, normalization, and transformation.
Feature Engineering: Feature selection, feature engineering, and data transformations.
Modeling:
  Classification: Decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithms.
  Regression: Linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and polynomial regression.
  Clustering: K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.
Model Training and Evaluation: Training, validation, and test phases, model evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1 score, ROC curve, etc.).
Model Improvement: Hyperparameter optimization, cross-validation, and grid search.
Visualization: Visualizing model results, learning curves, and error analysis.
